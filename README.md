After watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Riqjdh2oM&t=3188s&ab_channel=MicrosoftResearch) lecture on quantum computing I decided to follow along with some code of my own. So here is a function to find the factors of a set of binary vectors, some Quantum gate operators using numpy, and a ramshackle proof that quantum computers can "outperform" classical computers in some problem spaces.
